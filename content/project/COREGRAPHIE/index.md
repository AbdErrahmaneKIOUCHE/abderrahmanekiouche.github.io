The COREGRAPHIE project aims to develop algorithms and tools that allow to compute simpler and smaller representations of graphs, i.e., summaries, that can be used instead of the initial graphs, and to refine them according to the quality of the obtained summaries as well as the operations they allow to undertake. The advantage of such approach is to process massive graph data in linear or quasi-linear time.

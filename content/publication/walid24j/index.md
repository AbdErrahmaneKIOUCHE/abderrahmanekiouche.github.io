abstract: Many activities in the cybersecurity realm can be represented using graph streams, such as call graphs. In this paper,c we introduce an innovative method to detect Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) from their onset. Unique to our approach is the ability to assimilate both structural and temporal aspects, which are crucial for differentiating between benign and malicious activities. To overcome challenges presented by streaming data processing, we leverage hashing techniques for compact data representation. This method, when combined with a dynamic machine learning framework, facilitates swift, incremental detection while ensuring minimal memory usage. Empirical evaluations underscore the efficacy of our approach, enabling real-time response by pinpointing APTs at the initial stages of their activity.
summary: Our approach detects Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) in graph streams by integrating both structural and temporal analysis. We overcome streaming data challenges using hashing techniques for compact representation and a dynamic machine learning framework for incremental detection with minimal memory usage. Empirical evaluations confirm its effectiveness, enabling real-time APT detection at early stages.
